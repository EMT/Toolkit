Chrome Pro Tips
===============

In the console type 

`document.designMode = "on"`

This makes the page easily editable (useful for changing text for screenshots etc). You can make a bookmarklet out of this
by creating a new bookmark with the following line as the URL.

`javascript:void(document.designMode = 'on')`
