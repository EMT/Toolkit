The Fieldwork Toolkit
=====================

The Fieldwork Toolkit is the result of documenting our processes and tools as they develop. It’s a framework that helps us make better things more efficiently.

## Key Concepts 

People – their skills, experience, knowledge and ability to adapt – are the key to solving problems and making things that work. We’re not interested in creating a paint-by-numbers method for making things. We want a framework that works **because** of the skills of the people using it, not **despite** them. Tools we can use and adapt on a project-by-project basis, that help us work with varying requirements and constraints.

### Grow as we grow

This will develop along with us and our projects, encompassing the collection, synthesis and distillation of the things we learn about making things. We will:

- Test new ideas
- Document what we learn
- Iterate and improve

### Tools that help

The toolkit will contain a collection of tools that help us devise, navigate and implement a process for making things, including techniques to help with:

- Project discovery
- Overcoming common sticking points in the design process
- Speeding up development work
- Covering all the bases
- Communicating with clients and collaborators

### Focus on making

The toolkit should prioritise making over thinking and talking. 

- Prototype early
- Iterate quickly
- Collaborate with clients
- Make the early phases of discovery and design more tangible
- Do weekend projects

### Adaptable process

Although the toolkit will contain an overarching conceptual process, the tangible steps implemented for any given project should be composed on-the-fly, according to the project requirements and constraints. 

We’re good at being creative, having ideas, improvising, and reading the tiny nuances of a project. This toolkit has to play to those strengths, and push us to become even better at them.
